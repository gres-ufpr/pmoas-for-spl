**Abstract**

Evolutionary Multi-Objective Algorithms (EMOAs) have been applied to derive products for the variability testing of Software Product Lines (SPLs), which is a complex task impacted by many factors, such as the number of products to be tested, coverage criteria, and efficacy to reveal faults. But such algorithms generally produce a lot of solutions that are uninteresting to the tester. This happens because traditional search algorithms do not take into consideration the user preferences. To ease the selection of the best solutions and avoid effort generating uninteresting solutions, this work introduces an approach that applies Preference-Based Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithms (PEMOAs) to solve the problem. The approach is multi-objective, working with the number of products to be tested, pairwise coverage and mutation score. It incorporates the preferences before the evolution process and uses the Reference Point (RP) method. Two PEMOAs are evaluated: R-NSGA-II and r-NSGA-II, using two different formulations of objectives, and three kinds of RPs. PEMOAs outperform the traditional NSGA-II by generating a greater number of solutions in the Region of Interest (ROI) associated to the RPs. The use of PEMOAs can reduce the tester's burden in the task of selecting a better and reduced set of products for SPL testing.
